# Assignment - Day 2:

Choose a topic that your group really cares about and put together a small informational website using HTML/CSS.

* This site should be 2-3 pages and look as professional as possible using modern design trends.

Research similar websites to get inspiration. You may utilize

Bootstrap if you like.

* Once you have decided on a cause, begin by selecting one teammate to create a Git repo with an index.html file, push it to GitHub, then add the other teammates as collaborators on the repo.

* Throughout this workshop each teammate should be communicating often and using GitHub effectively. Remember no one should be working off Master so create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and create and close issues.
