## Express Routing, Reading, Writing Practice
For all of these assignments you can use the templating engine of your choice.
You are not limited to just one of these exercises! If you finish one and feel solid about your understanding, you can move onto another option on this page. The goal is to leave this practice with strong comfort in routing, rendering the view, and reading and writing data in an Express app.

### If you need more practice with routing or want to practice building another app in Express:

* Intermediate option: You are going to build a weather app that allows the user to enter a city into a form and get back the weather from the city. You may use a weather API of your choosing. [An example of what this could look like is here](https://simple-nodejs-weather-app-irhhpddsku.now.sh/). BONUS: Connect to a second API and deliver weather + another piece of location-based information to the user when they enter their city.

* Beginner option: [Follow this walkthrough.](https://codeburst.io/build-a-weather-website-in-30-minutes-with-node-js-express-openweather-a317f904897b)

### If you need more practice reading and writing data:
For this assignment, you'll be creating a program that can read from multiple files and writes a new file using that data.
Below are detailed instructions for your program:
* Read in a file, named "people.json", which contains a list of people.
* Read in another file, named "people2.json", which contains another list of people.
* After both of these files have been read, write a new file called "peopleComplete.txt" which contains a sorted listof all the people from the first two files.
Bonus:
Read in the files from a people directory, and merge all of the files in the directory into a "peopleComplete.json" file

### If you want an advanced option:
Revisit the to-do list project you made in React and connect it to an Express back end that will save list data after it is entered by the user. Configuration of Express + React can be found [here](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/)
