## Final Projects

We will be working in groups to create full-stack apps that will be presented on the last day. 

Your app must:
* Take in user input
* Process user input on the server side
* Read and/or write to a database
* Have a front end with a well-thought-out user experience (hint: wire frame first)

### First steps
By Tuesday morning, please do the following:
* Form a group of 2 or 3 collaborators
* Think of at least 3 app ideas, and publish those on your personal .md file in our class Github repo.

### Project Mode Schedule
* Tuesday morning: First meeting with collaborators. Pitch ideas. Decide on app idea. Set up Github repo. Divide up responsibilities. Wireframe front end and UX. Determine MVP that shows most basic functionality and then what features you will build next (project timeline).

* Tuesday afernoon: Building begins. Optional small group walkthrough with Express and database routing.

* Wednesday and Thursday all day: Project mode

* Friday: completing projects, deployment

* Friday from 2-4pm: DEMO DAY

#### Demo Day:
* Premise: You are pitching your app to potential stakeholders. 
* What is your app? Why is is useful? What niche does it fill? (Slides may be helpful here, as simply demonstrating your app is not enough!)
* Demo your app and all of its features
* Walk through any key features of the code by showing the code on screen
* Q&A
