Social News Feed App

We will be using React to build a social media news feed.

You will need to create a component that includes an image, caption, author, and at least one button that toggles (for example: a like button that is highlighted upon click and unhighlighted upon a second click). Your news feed will be a list of these components with unique social media data. (You are free to fictionalize this data.)

Once you have built your news feed, decide on some functionality for the user to customize their feed:
* Delete posts they do not want to see
* Temporarily hide posts
* Order newsfeed by most recent post 
* Add an emoji to a post
* Location link to Google Maps
* Any other functionality you and your team decide

For an example of what a newsfeed in React could look like, you can look at [this example](https://codepen.io/JiaYuisalolicon/pen/xYjwyE). Note that this example does not include button functionality or next steps in customization. It is meant only for a visual reference.

This will be a pair programming exercise: two people, one computer. Each team member will pull request the same link to your project folder or repository in their assignment folder.

We will continue working on this assignment tomorrow, Day 8, and it will be due by the beginning of class on Friday, Day 9.
