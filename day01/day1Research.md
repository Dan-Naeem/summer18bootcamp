# Day 1 Research:

Begin researching the company where you will be doing your internship. You will be giving a 5-minute presentation on your findings.

* The presentation should be well-researched and include a slide deck. You may collaborate with other students who will be interning at the same company.

**You should look into the following:**
* What products do they have?
* Year founded
* Round of funding
* Number of people on staff
* Business model
* Technical staff breakdown
* Founder background
* Competitors
