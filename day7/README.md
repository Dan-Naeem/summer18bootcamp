To-Do App:

Re-visit your source code from the code-along on Monday where you built a list.

You are going to transform this list into a to-do list that has the ability to add and delete, and star important items.

Think about what additional functionality makes sense for a to-do list. Can the user check items off of the list? Can the user re-order the items? You are free to implement any ideas you can come up with.

We will be submitting this assignment under Day 7 at the end of this morning's session.
