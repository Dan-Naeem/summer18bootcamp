## Node, Express and Databases

Now that we have all of the pieces of the puzzle, our goal is to connect our database to our Express framework.

Please walk through this tutorial using sequelize to get a feel for how everything connects. [Node and Express tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-express-and-postgres-using-sequelize)

If you already feel ready to tackle this without a tutorial, here are a few options:

* Revisit your to-do app, this time reading, writing, and updating data to a database, rather than a JSON file. 

* If you easily complete this task, create a new app. Your new app requires users to create a username and password in order to log in, and that information will be written to a database. Your app could then check for the correct credentials and welcome the user after properly logging in (or serve up an error message if they enter the incorrect login information).
