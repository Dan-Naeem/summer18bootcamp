## More Express Templating Practice

You are going to create a simple express app that includes a list that is rendered to the front end. When the user clicks on a list item, it will direct to a new route that includes additional information about that item. (Example, if the topic is "Cars," the user could click on an item named "Honda Civic" and be directed to a page with more information about Honda Civics.)

You can choose the templating engine you would like to work with for this project.
