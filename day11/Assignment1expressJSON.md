## Writing data to an Express Project

You are going to create a new Express app that allows for user input via a form on the front end. (Example: username and email) That data should be taken in and written to a JSON file, which you will use as a miniature database. If you are able to successfully write data to the file, you can also add in a view to see all of the data in the JSON file.

There is an example project in this repo that you can view to deconstruct the server-side logic, but please create your own. You may do this alone or in pairs.
