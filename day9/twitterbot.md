Today's assignment is to use node.js and a Twitter node package (we used 'twit' in today's demo) to create a customized Twitterbot.

What can my bot do? The sky is the limit!

*Query for a specific key word and retweet all posts with that key word. 

*Post every word from a specific book

*Post a "thank you" message to anyone who follows you

*Interact with another API and post data from that API. (Example: Pull today's headlines from the New York Times API and post them in individual tweets.)

Submission:

You may complete this in pairs or alone. When you submit your assignment, please post a link to your github repo AND a link to your Twitterbot account. 

NOTE: DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR API KEYS TO GITHUB. Include them in a config file, which you should then include in a gitignore. [More on gitignore here](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)
